   TO
   JOHN VINE MILNE
   MY DEAR FATHER,

   Like all really nice people, you have a weakness for detective
   stories, and feel that there are not enough of them.  So, after
   all that you have done for me, the least that I can do for you
   is to write you one.   Here it is: with more gratitude and
   affection than I can well put down here.

   A.A.M.
